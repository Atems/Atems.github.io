    <h1>Millenial Dad</h1>
    <img src="images/milenial dad.png" alt="dad and son image">
    <p>I am what they call a millennial.  By this I mean a few things: I was born between 1980 and 2000, I am part of the culture that grew up with the middle eastern wars, the explosion of the internet and technology, and the group that took the heaviest hit from the great recession.  I feel like mentioning these things because they influenced my life in gigantic ways that I would not have guessed when I was a small child.  I am a 30-year-old father of two boys, husband to a sweet woman, as well as an unemployed combat veteran with a degree from a high-tier university.  This blog will attempt to describe some of my hopes and fears, joys and sorrows of our present time that we all live in.</p>
    <p>This website will casually address:
      <ul>
        <li>My Daily Life</li>
        <li>My Philosophy</li>
        <li>The Meaning of Being a Dad</li>
      </ul>
